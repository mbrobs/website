abstract: 'This paper summarizes experimental results and discusses the development
  and benchmarking of detailed 3D finite element method (FEM) models for large-scale
  planar composite plate shear wall/concrete filled (C-PSW/CF) specimens subjected
  to constant axial force and cyclic lateral loading. The results from the benchmarked
  3D FEM models are used to develop phenomenological effective stress-strain relationships
  for the steel plates and concrete infill of the tested C-PSW/CF specimens. The proposed
  effective stress-strain relationships implicitly account for various aspects governing
  behavior such as: (i) steel yielding and hardening in tension, (ii) steel yielding
  and local buckling in compression; (iii) concrete cracking in tension, (iv) concrete
  inelasticity in compression, and (v) composite interaction resulting in biaxial
  stresses in the tension steel and confinement of the concrete in compression. These
  proposed effective stress-strain relationships are used in simpler 2D FEM models
  and fiber-based FEM models along with calibrated cyclic hysteresis rules and damage
  models to simulate the cyclic behavior of C-PSW/CF specimens and compare with experimental
  results. These simpler 2D FEM models and fiber-based FEM models are recommended
  for simulating the seismic response of planar C-PSW/CF walls. The detailed 3D FEM
  models are recommended for conducting additional parametric studies investigating
  the structural behavior and design of planar C-PSW/CF walls.'
