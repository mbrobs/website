 abstract = {This paper summarizes experimental results and discusses the development and benchmarking of detailed 3D finite element method (FEM) models for large-scale planar composite plate shear wall/concrete filled (C-PSW/CF) specimens subjected to constant axial force and cyclic lateral loading. The results from the benchmarked 3D FEM models are used to develop phenomenological effective stress-strain relationships for the steel plates and concrete infill of the tested C-PSW/CF specimens. The proposed effective stress-strain relationships implicitly account for various aspects governing behavior such as: (i) steel yielding and hardening in tension, (ii) steel yielding and local buckling in compression; (iii) concrete cracking in tension, (iv) concrete inelasticity in compression, and (v) composite interaction resulting in biaxial stresses in the tension steel and confinement of the concrete in compression. These proposed effective stress-strain relationships are used in simpler 2D FEM models and fiber-based FEM models along with calibrated cyclic hysteresis rules and damage models to simulate the cyclic behavior of C-PSW/CF specimens and compare with experimental results. These simpler 2D FEM models and fiber-based FEM models are recommended for simulating the seismic response of planar C-PSW/CF walls. The detailed 3D FEM models are recommended for conducting additional parametric studies investigating the structural behavior and design of planar C-PSW/CF walls.},
