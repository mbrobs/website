abstract: 'Composite Plate Shear Walls−Concrete Filled (C-PSW/CF) are an innovative
  seismic force resisting system recently adapted for building applications. The walls
  consist of parallel steel faceplates connected with tie bars and filled with concrete.
  This paper summarizes the results of a recent FEMA P695 study completed to verify
  seismic design parameters for uncoupled C-PSW/CFs with rectangular flange plate
  boundary elements. Seven archetype structures were: (i) designed, (ii) modeled using
  a benchmarked fiber-based finite element analysis approach, (iii) subjected to nonlinear
  pushover analysis, (iv) and to incremental nonlinear dynamic analysis to failure
  for 22-sets of scaled ground motions, and (v) the results were statistically analyzed
  to assess performance. These structures ranged from three (3) to twenty-two (22)
  stories and included both planar and C-shaped configurations. As part of this design
  process, recommendations for stiffness approximations for linear analysis of C-PSW/CFs
  were developed. Additionally, these nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis results
  were post-processed to determine the rotation and strain demands at the base of
  these structures at the design basis, maximum considered, and failure level earthquakes.
  These results showed that the rotation and strain demand at failure level earthquakes
  were comparable regardless of the ground motion. Ultimately, this FEMA P695 approach
  verified the R factor of 6.5, Cd factor of 5.5, and Ω0 of 2.5 for C-PSW/CFs with
  boundary elements.'
