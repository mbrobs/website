Dr. Morgan Broberg is an Assistant Professor in Civil Engineering at the University of Arkansas. Before joining U of A, she received her B.S. from LeTourneau University (Texas) and her Ph.D. from Purdue University (Indiana). Her research focuses on developing sustainable, robust, and resilient infrastructure solutions. To this end, she investigates the behavior, analysis, and design of new and existing structures subjected to natural and manmade hazards including earthquake, wind, blast, and impact loads.  

Dr. Broberg designs structural systems, conducts large-scale tests, and develops computational modeling approaches for many innovative solutions. She works with public and private sponsors to design, validate, and implement SC technologies for seismic and protective structure applications. Her work has resulted in several updates to codes and standards including ASCE 7, AISC 360, and AISC 341. Outside of the office, Dr. Broberg enjoys many hobbies such as getting outdoors, board games, puzzles, and bowling.
